# Powerbi
A global supermarket data set in Power BI is a collection of information about the sales and operations of supermarkets around the world. This information can be visualized in a dashboard, which allows users to easily view and analyze the data in a variety of ways. The dashboard can include charts, tables, and maps that show key metrics such as sales by location, product categories, and time period. Users can also filter and drill down into the data to gain deeper insights. Overall, the dashboard provides a convenient and user-friendly way to access and understand the data, making it useful for managers, analysts, and other stakeholders.
